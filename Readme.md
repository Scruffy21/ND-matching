# Memory Game
A project made for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.  A card-matching game.

## Functionality: 
* display timer, moves counter, star rating

## Current themes: 
* Animals

## Browsers
The project is intended for modern browsers that support ES6 syntax.

There is a problem with IE11 that I'm working on. Cards don't show their backside at the moment.
